                The wireless cave communication module was my 5th year Capstone project. The project, sponsored by Dr. Carl Michal of UBC Physics and Astronomy, was
                inspired by the Thai soccer team that was trapped in and rescued from the flooded Tham Luang cave in 2018. <br><br>

                Dr. Michal’s vision for the project was to create a network of floating communication devices that could transmit text messages through the air and
                through water in parallel as a redundancy measure. My team narrowed the scope of the project to develop the underwater wireless text messaging system.
                By reverse engineering a fish finder we used an acoustic transducer to successfully send and receive text messages at 6 characters per second up to 100
                meters apart. Focusing our design on robustness, we reduced our message error rate to 2%.<br><br>

                Controller Area Network (CANBus) is a vehicle communication standard that allows microcontrollers to communicate without having to rely on
                a host computer. The UBC Supermileage team uses CANBus to control the function of accessories in their urban concept vehicle. This includes
                sounding the horn, actuating the window wipers and turning on the headlights. <br><br>

                The CAN Accessory boards consist of a microcontroller and a series of connectors that allow a modular plug and play functionality for
                different accessories. CANBus allows a series of boards to be connected throughout the vehicle and they can all talk to eachother.

                Matthew Mitchell and Dr. Jeff Young involved devising methods to study the mechanical loss associated with coatings used in LIGO’s
                gravitational wave interferometers. Their work involved depositing a coating on mechanical disks and then vibrating them and measuring the
                amount of time it took for the vibrations to stop giving them information about the loss associated with each coating. <br><br>

                Our team devised a system for measuring the coating loss, redesigning the mechanical disks to better suit LIGO’s system and devising a

                This project was implemented for UBC’s ENPH 353 course competition which was a time trial to drive through a race course and identify a series of
                license plates. My teammate and I’s implementation utilizes a mix of machine learning and computer vision methods written using the
                <a href="https://keras.io/" target="blank" class="embedded-link">Keras</a>,
                <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras" target="blank" class="embedded-link">TensorsFlow</a> and
                <a href="https://opencv.org/" target="blank" class="embedded-link">OpenCV2</a> libraries in Python. Our solution was split into vehicle navigation,
                obstacle detection and license plate identification. <br><br>

                First, the self-driving car has to efficiently navigate through. We used an imitation learning method
                to predict vehicle steering angles and velocity given images taken by three on-board cameras. We trained our neural network to predict one of 5 possible
                driving commands given an image input from a single on-board camera. The network architecture is shown below:

            <div class = "project-background">
                Next, we had to consider the pedestrians and a car that acted like obstacles in the course. For obstacle detection we used gray masks tuned to the
                color of the pedestrian and car respectively and compared the number of gray pixels to a threshold value to determine if an obstacle was present and
                if the car should stop. Below we have the images that show the gray mask if an obstacle is present (left) or not (right).

            <div class = "project-background">
                Finally,  we had to drive past a series of license plates and identify them. This involved generating a set of test plates that our neural network
                could train off of and then in the simulation, taking pictures and segmenting the characters so that our neural network could identify their value
                and position on the license plate.<br> <br>

                This project consisted of a series of MATLAB simulations to study numerical/finite difference methods such as the Crank-Nicholson and Alternating Direction
                Implicit Methods for solving partial differential equations, specifically the 1D and 2D Schro&#776dinger equation. In quantum mechanics, Wave-particle
                duality states that every particle or quantum entity has both particle and wave-like properties. The non-dimensionalized Schro&#776dinger equation is given by:
                <img src="images/projects/double/wavefnc.jpg" class="eqn" >
                The Schro&#776dinger equation allows us to determine the wave function ψ of a system which relates the location of a particle at a given point in space(x, y, z)
                at a particular time (t) to the wave amplitude. The amplitude of the wave function has no real significance. However the square of the wave function, is the
                probability of finding an electron at a given point. <br><br>

                Finite difference methods are a class of numerical techniques that convert/discretize ordinary and partial differential equations into a system of linear equations
                that can be solved using matrix algebra. In the simulations I implemented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank%E2%80%93Nicolson_method" target="blank" class="embedded-link">Crank-Nicholson</a>
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating-direction_implicit_method" target="blank" class="embedded-link">Alternating Direction Implicit Methods</a> and studied how the solutions to the wave equation
                changed with respect to different potentials (initial and boundary conditions). <br><br>

                we see that the wave function does not have enough energy to overcome the potential thus the probability of it ending inside the confines of the barrier is
                zero. Next, we consider the wave function starting inside the well which is analogous to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_box" target="blank" class="embedded-link">particle in a box</a>.
                In a classical system a particle trapped in a box is no more likely to be found at one position over another. In a quantum system the particle may only occupy
                certain energy levels (related to the geometry and potential of the box) meaning it may be more likely to occupy certain positions in the box leading to the

                When the world shut down due to the covid pandemic in 2020 I spent my summer in my basement designing and building this robot. My team worked on this remotely
                as part of the ENPH 253 robot summer competition. The objective was to design a robot that could pick up 6 empty pop cans and dump them in a recycling bin in
                under 60 seconds.

                With the pandemic we had to think outside of the box and build the robot out of readily available materials instead of machining parts and I also had to do
                all of my circuit debugging with a handheld single channel oscilloscope which was certainly a fun challenge.<br><br>

                The design my team came up with consisted of a ultrasonic distance sensor to detect the presence of cans, an IR sensor for homing navigation to the recycling
                bin, an H-bridge to drive the motors, a scooping arm and holding bucket that were actuated by servo motors. I soldered all of the circuits and assembled the rest
                of the robot using materials such as corrugated plastic, zip ties and hot glue. Check out the firmware for line following, can detection and homing
