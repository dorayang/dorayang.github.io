    <div class = "bio">
        <p class = "bio-text">I am a hardworking engineer with a degree from the University of British Columbia’s Engineering Physics program.
            The rigorous academic requirements of the program paired with project courses have given me a distinctive set of theoretical knowledge
            and technical skills that can be translated to many roles. I’d love to work in the biotech and wearables industries but I am keen to
            join any organizations that are designing novel and innovative devices. Specifically, I am looking for hardware design, testing or systems engineering roles.<br>
            <br>

            I’ve had unique work and extracurricular experiences where I’ve developped maternal vital signs monitoring solutions for the Gates foundation, designed power supplies for quantum computers,
            done R&D for a commercial nanomedicine assembly device, assisted with Canada's spectrum management of the 6GHz band and designed several PCBs
            for hyper fuel efficient cars @ UBC Supermileage. <br>
            <br>
            Outside of the technical stuff I am passionate about diversity in STEM, sustainability and community building and have been heavily involved
            with UBC’s Women in Engineering chapter, figure skating club and Amnesty International chapter in lead, event planning and graphic design roles. <br>
            <br>
            In my spare time I keep myself busy with figure skating, long distance running, exploring the outdoors, taking film photos and doing random arts and crafts (currently very into knitting!!).
